## How this project is organized

    src
    â”œâ”€â”€ assets                  # Images and Icons
    â”œâ”€â”€ components              # Separated UI components
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ atoms               # Granular UI components
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ molecules           # UI pieces
    â”œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ organisms           # UI Block components
    â”œâ”€â”€ constants               # constants/data
    â”œâ”€â”€ hooks                   # Custom hooks
    â”œâ”€â”€ store                   # zustand store files
    â”œâ”€â”€ utils                   # utils/reusable files
    â””â”€â”€ App.tsx                 # Entry point


There are two approaches to handle the Video actions:
- Using `zustand` as required in the Take home description
- Using a simple hook called `useVideoPlayer`. Since this is a very small case for web player, the hook would be useful.

In case you want to try boths approaches just go to `App.tsx` and uncomment the import `import { VideoBlock } from "components/organisms/VideoBlockUsingHook";`
